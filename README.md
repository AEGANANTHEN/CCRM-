üß¨ Evolution of Java

1991: Java was initiated at Sun Microsystems as "Oak".

1995: Renamed to Java and released as JDK 1.0.

1997: JDK 1.1 introduced inner classes, JavaBeans, and RMI.

2004: JDK 5.0 introduced generics, metadata annotations, and the enhanced for-loop.

2017: JDK 9 introduced the module system.

2021: JDK 17 became the latest Long-Term Support (LTS) release.

‚öñÔ∏è Java ME vs SE vs EE
Edition	Purpose	Use Cases
SE	Core Java libraries and APIs	Desktop applications, utilities
EE	Enterprise-level applications	Web apps, enterprise systems
ME	Mobile and embedded devices	Mobile apps, IoT devices

Note: Java ME is now largely replaced by Android development.

üß± JDK vs JRE vs JVM

JDK (Java Development Kit): A full-featured software development kit for Java, including JRE and development tools like compilers.

JRE (Java Runtime Environment): Provides libraries, Java Virtual Machine (JVM), and other components to run applications written in Java.

JVM (Java Virtual Machine): Executes Java bytecode and provides platform independence.
